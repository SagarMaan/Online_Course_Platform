Objective: Build a backend system for a ticket booking application that allows users to search for and book tickets for various events or shows.

Requirements:

Database Design:

Design a database schema to store information related to users, events, tickets, and bookings. You can use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Identify the necessary tables and their relationships, such as users, events, tickets, and bookings. Define the appropriate columns for each table.

User Management:

Implement a user authentication system to allow users to register and log in.

Store user credentials securely, preferably by hashing passwords.

Users should be able to update their profile information.


Event Management:

Create APIs to manage events, allowing administrators to add, update, and delete event information.

Store information about events, such as event name, date, time, venue, available tickets, and ticket prices.

Users should be able to view the list of available events.


Ticket Booking:

Implement APIs to handle ticket booking requests.

Users should be able to search for events based on criteria such as event name, date, venue, etc.

Users should be able to select an event and book tickets for a specified number of attendees.

Handle scenarios where multiple users may try to book the same ticket simultaneously.

Reduce the number of available tickets and create a booking entry in the database.

Generate a unique booking ID or ticket number for each booking.


Ticket Cancellation:

Implement APIs to handle ticket cancellation requests.

Users should be able to cancel their bookings and increase the number of available tickets for the event.

Remove the booking entry from the database.


Booking History:

Users should be able to view their booking history, including details of the events they have booked, the number of 
tickets, and the booking status.


Security and Validation:

Implement input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Implement proper error handling and error messages for various scenarios.


Testing:

Write unit tests to validate the functionality of each API endpoint.

Perform thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

Deployment and Documentation:

Deploy the backend application on a hosting platform or server of your choice.

Document the API endpoints and their functionalities, including request/response formats and any required authentication.

Provide instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Consider using a web framework like Django, Flask, or Express.js to streamline the development process. You can 
also use libraries like SQLAlchemy or Mongoose for interacting with the database.
